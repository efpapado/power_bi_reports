# power_bi_reports
Drupal module for Power BI Reports embedding


# Installation

You need to download the Microsoft/PowerBI-JavaScript library
(https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-JavaScript)
The module was developed under the v2.7.2 of the library, so this is
the only version guaranteed to work.

The library should be placed under `sites/all/libraries/powerbi_javascript`
folder (so that the js file can be located under
`sites/all/libraries/powerbi_javascript/dist/powerbi.min.js`)
